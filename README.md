## :innocent: Motivation
Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there are no efficient face mask detection applications which are now in high demand for transportation means, densely populated areas, residential districts, large-scale manufacturers and other enterprises to ensure safety. The absence of large datasets of __â€˜with_maskâ€™__ images has made this task cumbersome and challenging. 


## :warning: TechStack/framework used

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [Keras](https://keras.io/)
- [Keras Tuner](https://keras.io/keras_tuner/)

## :star: Features
Our face mask detector doesn't use any morphed masked images dataset and the model is accurate. This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.

## :file_folder: Dataset
The dataset used can be downloaded here - [Click to Download](https://www.kaggle.com/ashishjangra27/face-mask-12k-images-dataset)

This dataset consists of __~12k images__ belonging to two classes:
*	with_mask and without_mask

## :key: Prerequisites

All the dependencies and required libraries are included in the file <code>requirements.txt</code> [See here](https://github.com/nikhil121101/FaceMaskDetection/blob/main/requirements.txt)

## ðŸš€&nbsp; Installation
1. Clone the repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com/nikhil121101/FaceMaskDetection.git
```

2. Change your directory to the cloned repo 
```
$ cd FaceMaskDetection
```

3. Create a Python virtual environment named 'test' and activate it
```
$ virtualenv test
```
```
$ source test/bin/activate
```

4. Now, run the following command in your Terminal/Command Prompt to install the libraries required
```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## :bulb: Working

To detect face masks in real-time video streams type the following command:
```
$ python testing_on_webcam.py 
```
## :key: Results

#### Our model gave 99% accuracy for Face Mask Detection after training on google colab
